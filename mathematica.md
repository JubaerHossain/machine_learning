# Mathematica by stephen wolfram

> Book : A New Kind of Science

> the invenstion of a new kind of symblolic computer language that could for the first time manipulate the very wide range of objects involved in  technical computing using only a fairly small number of basic primitives.

> The diversity of Mathematica's user base is striking

At a technical level, Mathemetica is widely regarded as a majore feat of software engineering,
It is one of the largest single application programs ever developed and it contains a vast array of novel algorithms and important technical innovations.

> Among its core innovations are its interconnected algorithms knowledgebase, and its concepts of symbolic programming and of document-centered interfaces.

> `MPS Linear programming format`

> Mathematica is a system built on a fairly small set of very powerful principles, This book describes those principles but by no means spells out all of their implications.

> Mathematica is an open software system that can be customized in a wide variety of ways.



### Transformation rules in the context of algebraic expressions.
the basic principle of transformation rules applies to any symbloic expression.

## Types of programs

## 1.0 Running Mathematica
The structure of mathematics calculations is the same in all cases.
You enter input, then Mathematica processes it, and returns a result.

> `Textually based operating system.`

> `//N always gives the approximate numerical result`

> rational numbers
> `1/3+2/7 = 13/21`

## Mathematical Functions

* Square root = Sqrt
* Exponential = Exp
* Natural logarithm = Log
* Logarithm to base b = Log [b,x]
* Trigonometric functions (with arguments in radians) Sin[x], Cos[x], Tan[x]
* Inverse trigonometric functions = ArchSin[x]. ArchCos[x], ArcTan[x]
* Factorial (product of integers 1,2,....,n) = n!
* Absolutte value = Abs[x]
* Closest integer to x = Round[x]
* n Modulo m (remainder on division of n by m) = Mod[n,m] n%m
* Pseudorandaom number between 0 and 1 = Random[]
* Maximum, minimum of x,y, ... = Max[x,y,...], Min[x,y...]
* Primce factors of n = FactorInteger[n]
